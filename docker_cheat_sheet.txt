//How to get an image?

That is a very simple task, Use:

      Docker image <image_name>

  Example for running ubuntu:

      Docker pull ubuntu

      docker pull kalilinux/kali-linux-docker

//How to remove an image

      Docker rmi <cha> 


//How to create a container?

In order to create a container we use the following command:

      Docker run <container>

  Example Running a nginx container:

      Docker run --name nginx_server -d -p 80:80 <nginx>

  Example Running a mysql container:

      Docker run --name mysqlDB -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=True <mysql>

So lets explain...

      Docker run <container>  //This is the basic way to run a container

      -p //Specifies a port example 80:80

      -d //For detach. It means run in the back ground

      -e //For export, same as linux

      --name //To name your container. Very helpful

      -t //terminal

      -i //interactive

N.B: "Always check the tons of documentation available online for how to run any
      container you needed."
