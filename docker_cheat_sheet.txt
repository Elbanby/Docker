//How to get an image?

That is a very simple task, Use:

      Docker image <image_name>

  Example for running ubuntu:

      Docker pull ubuntu

      docker pull kalilinux/kali-linux-docker

//How to check for all available images

      docker images

//How to remove an image

      Docker rmi <cha>    //Remove image if not in use
      Docker rmi -f <cha> //Stop containers and force remove the image


//How to create a container?

In order to create a container we use the following command:

      Docker run <container>

  Example Running a nginx container:

      Docker run --name nginx_server -d -p 80:80 <nginx>

  Example Running a mysql container:

      Docker run --name mysqlDB -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=True <mysql>

So lets explain...

      Docker run <container>  //This is the basic way to run a container

      -p //Specifies a port example 80:80

      -d //For detach. It means run in the back ground

      -e //For export, same as linux

      --name //To name your container. Very helpful

      -t //terminal

      -i //interactive

N.B: "To create a container with terminal use -it <kernel for example (bash)>"

N.B: "Always check the tons of documentation available online for how to run any
      container you needed."


//How to check which containers are running?

    Old way: Docker ps  (I personally like it)
    new way: Docker container ls

//How to see all containers created?

    Old way: Docker ps -a
    new way: Docker container ls -a

//How to remove a container?

    1- Docker stop <container_name OR cha>
    2- Docker rm <container_name OR cha>

//How to show the logs of a detached container?

    Docker container logs <container_name>

//How to see how a container was configured (in a JSON format)?

    Docker container inspect <container_name>

//How to monitor all running processes live?

    Docker container stats

//How to view processes running inside a container?

    Docker container top

//How to access a container that didn't have an -it option when configured?

    Docker container exec -it <kernal> <container_name>

//How to access a container that already has an -it tag on it?

    Docker container start -ai <container_name>
